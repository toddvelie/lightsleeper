Light Sleeper
========
This is a python project using a Rapberry Pi 2 to drive an LED in a pulsing pattern.
The pulse runs for 20 mins, starting at a moderately slow rate, then slowing to a
full sleeping breathing pattern.

The LED will start when you press button 1, and will through the 20 min cycle.

#### Usage instructions
Press Button 1 to start a 20 min cycle.
Press Button 2 to shut off LED.

#### Future enhancements
Add a different, selectable cycle length.
Add starting and stopping breathing rates, controllable via a text file setting.
Perhaps also have cycle lengths in text file, and allow it to be selectable.
